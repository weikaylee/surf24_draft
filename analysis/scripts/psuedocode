DAILY TEMP BINS
for each year: 
  for each file in year: 
    determine max and min temp for each pixel / area, by either iterating through each pixel in all files OR by finding some function...can also create own helper function here 
    from min and max, get avg temp 
  store data in single-layer raster 

create helper function that takes in a raster: iterate through each pixel in raster, and count how many pixels fall into each bin. return dataframe? 
  do this for each of the three rasters created above: max, min, avg temps

DIURNAL RANGE BINS
using above rasters, get diurnal range bin (just do simple raster math lol: subtract max and min rasters) 

HEAT WAVE DAY COUNTS
for each year: 
  for each pixel in corresponding min raster: 
  iterate through each pixel. get city (??) using crs??? and then get historical temp for that city. then do simple if statement to count num heatwaves each year. 
  
or...

construct max, min, avg rasters: 
intialize a dictionary of rasters for min, max, and avg, mapping year to raster
for each year: 
  for each pixel in raster (get dimensions prior to this, check if all the same): 
    initalize min and max
    for each file in year: 
      update min and max 
    store min and max in respective rasters
    calculate avg, store in respective raster 
  
construct temp bins for each raster (assuming we want one temp bin for each pixel location): 
create data frame
