# Estimating the Human Health Effects of Urban Heat in LA County
2024 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship project 
Mentor: Hannah Druckenmiller

## Abstract
Since the Industrial Revolution, Earthâ€™s global climate has warmed to unprecedented levels, driven largely and unequivocally by anthropogenic activities. This warming has led to wide-ranging consequences, including increased extreme weather events and poorer public health. Extreme heat in particular has become a key concern, due to its large role in public health as well as its prevalence in urban areas due to the urban heat island effect, in which the built environment elevates local temperatures. However, while the temperature increases associated with urban heat islands are comparable to those projected by end-of-century climate change scenarios, the impacts of urban heat have received relatively less attention from the public and policymakers. We aim to address this gap by estimating the human health effects of urban heat on mortality and morbidity across LA county at the zipcode level. We gather social vulnerability scores using socio-demographic data and incorporate measures of prolonged heat exposure derived from high-resolution, near-surface air temperature data into fixed effects and polynomial regression models. Our findings are generally consistent with past work in the literature and reveal that our measures and models may be applicable for informing mitigation measures at the local level.
